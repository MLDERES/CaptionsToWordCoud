00:49:28.334 --> 00:49:32.014
a little bit different yet,
and in this particular case

NOTE Confidence: 0.8921493

3dabf47e-7bd5-46e7-946f-9d26c0435639
00:49:32.014 --> 00:49:36.062
I've got a problem here in
this particular case we can

d0afc4c0-9c77-41ef-ad9d-671b088eede3
00:49:36.062 --> 00:49:37.534
do three different things.

b3c48b8a-bef4-44e1-9662-1265ee4ada99
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:43.921
The easiest way to apply
boosting is to actually drag a

5d9badbf-6533-4c50-af3b-ed20dc5e5ac1
00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:48.772
model called gradient boosted
tree. Here with this does is it

92d7bbd5-87a1-49cc-83f6-004a3f240c57
00:49:48.772 --> 00:49:53.182
actually applies. It looks like
what we described before where

715a08d1-3fd0-4f00-808d-58f69341c796
00:49:53.182 --> 00:49:58.474
we are taking a sample of the
data, sending it through finding

e25e9a4d-3d92-43aa-89a9-0c8ed9d4bfb7
00:49:58.474 --> 00:49:59.797
those things that.

47785a4f-40aa-43fd-b7ba-c5a8a09b7bad
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.273
Failed most often. Sending back
through, and so this applies all

3da58b0f-536b-4170-b823-ecb6ada4dc8f
00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:09.215
of the boosting for us. But in a
tree it's only in a tree.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.123
Another approach is to
actually use groups and I

NOTE Confidence: 0.90448695

a82d3a53-1c65-43a7-b6e8-a235ed763408
00:50:14.123 --> 00:50:17.139
should start over here
actually. So in this

c9987738-1a47-4087-9495-ca99d47068ce
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:17.893
particular group.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:24.679
So what I've done is this. This
is how we decide whether we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.88895184

4db25103-da0f-4ae4-9852-12c5def90880
00:50:24.679 --> 00:50:28.809
doing a boosting or bagging or
just a simple stratified

badc6ade-6dc0-4b77-b0b7-96f8a0d3637e
00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:33.352
approach or what have you for
different sampling. But in this

00:50:33.352 --> 00:50:38.308
particular case, what I've done
is I've done my start group and

f6a78196-09ae-4183-a19d-69a55c2d85bd
00:50:38.308 --> 00:50:44.090
I've got all my options here,
and so if I just want to do.

f1c519eb-cb18-4c52-9571-c30c8d5b6a1f

want to run this multiple times,

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.870

wanted to do it twice. The

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:59.310
results are combined together
into the best model an we get a

have any parameters at all, it's
just required so that the group

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:12.260
knows where to start, what to
apply before it goes back and.

f298fcfd-6b65-4eef-8f90-e0d2eb40b623
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:20.300
Reruns. The UM, another approach
is this one here, where what

5b20cc9b-3357-4493-bbb9-73b8ee55a48b
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.818
I've actually done is I've taken
a stratified approach.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.044
And so the stratified approach
is really interesting.

d4b4904f-9af0-4ebb-b6bf-279966d06ddf
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.228

show you something what I've

of the groups last week,
pointed out that

4abc1aa4-5244-4848-b2f6-62fbba014777
00:51:41.508 --> 00:51:46.032
neighborhoods on the top end
or seem to be or some of the

00:51:49.164 --> 00:51:53.340
and so I thought I would try
um stratifying on on the

cf9d19f6-ab17-403b-b2b3-8d529ec65e1f
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.472

where I would take.
